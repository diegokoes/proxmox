This repository archives my Proxmox home server: *container configs, network notes, backups and automation*.

The goal with it is to keep things I learn archived for reference when I find issues.

## Useful links

- [ProxmoxVE Helper Scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts)
- [ProxmoxVE DOCS](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/)

## My LXC containers

- MongoDB
- AdGuard Home
- Jenkins
- Postgresql

//TODO I have to add tailscale info + bird mounts, and the pct config for those containers

> RIP [tteck](https://github.com/tteck) and thanks for all the help <3
